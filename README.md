# Weather App
--------------------------------------------------

## Description

A Weather dashboard that shows current weather and a 5 day forecast based on location.
The user can search for a location and each search will be saved and added to the list.
The weather API data is using openweathermap (https://openweathermap.org/api).



## Functionality

the app has a default location on initial load just to populate the page. 
the list under the search input has a few major cities that can be clicked to see the weather results. When a search is made it is added to the list and saved in the local storage to save for later. The list will become scrollable if there are more than 6 there to stop pushing the forecast down the page.  
The uv index will change colour based on good, moderate, high levels of UV. 



## Improvements

Some things that need improving are: 
•better error handling. At the moment invalid searches will get added to the list.
also wrong or misspelled locations give a 404 in the console so I need to handle those. 

• use some custom icons.
